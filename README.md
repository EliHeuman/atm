The GitHub ATM Project is part of weeks 15 of the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development with MERN course.

## Description of the Project 
Creating a react app and adding Bootstrap to this project helped speed up production and styling. The project has two pages linked by a Navbar. The landing page has a Bio, and a short video, and the projects page showcases the projects I worked on during the past weeks at the MIT course.
